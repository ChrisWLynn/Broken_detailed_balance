# Broken_detailed_balance
Code and data for "Broken detailed balance and entropy production in the human brain" by Christopher W. Lynn, Eli J. Cornblath, Lia Papadopoulos, Maxwell A. Bertolero, and Danielle S. Bassett.

Data for undirected networks are in files labelled "graphs_[graph family]_samples_undirected.mat".

Data for directed networks are in files labelled "graphs_[graph family]_samples_directed.mat".

The main scripts used to analyze the networks are "script_rate_distortion_real_samples.m" and "script_rate_distortion_real_samples_directed.m".

The function used to compute the rate-distortion curve of a network is "rate_distortion_upper.m".
